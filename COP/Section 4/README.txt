---------------------------------------------
1. Write a java program to print first 10 natural numbers and their sum?

2. Write a java program to read 10 numbers from keyboard and find their  sum and average?

3. Write a program in java to display the multiplication table of a given integer?
>> Enter the number : 5
5 X 1 = 5
5 X 2 = 10
.
.
5 X 10 = 50


4. Write a program to calculate the factorial of the given number?

5. Write a program to display the pattern like right angle triangle using an asterisk as shown below:

*
**
***
****

6. Write a program to display the pattern like right angle triangle with a number as shown below : 
1
12
123
1234

7. Write a program to make such a pattern like right angle triangle with a number which will repeat a number in a row, as shown below : 
1
22
333
4444

8. Write a program to make such a pattern like right angle triangle with number increased by 1 as shown below : 
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10

9. Write a program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with an asterisk, as show below : 
   * 
  * *

10. Write a program to make such a pattern like a pyramid with a number which will repeat the number in the same row as shown below : 
   1
  2 2
 3 3 3
4 4 4 4

11. Write a program to check whether a given number is a perfect number or not?

Note : 
Defintion of Perfect Number : sum of all divisor of the number is equal to the number itself. 
eg.  Number = 6 is perfrect because
     All positive divisor = 1 2 3, their sum=6 
	 
12. Write a program to check whether a given number is an armstrong number or not?

Note : When the sum of the cube of the individual digits of a number is equal to that number, the number is called Armstrong number. For Example 153 is an Armstrong number because 153 = 1^3 +5^3 + 3^3.

13. Write a program to determine whether a given number is prime or not?

14. Write a program to display the first n terms of Fibonacci series. 

Fibonacci series 0 1 2 3 5 8 13 .....
Test Data :
Input number of terms to display : 10
Expected Output :
Here is the Fibonacci series upto to 10 terms :
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


15. Write a program to display the number in reverse order.

16. Write a program to check whether a number is a palindrome or not.
Note: If reverse of a number is same as that of number , then it is called palindrome. eg. 11, 151, 121,

17.  Write a program to check whether a given number is a Strong Number or not?
Note : If sum of factorial of each digit of a number is equal to that number, then that number is called strong number.

18. Write a program to find the length of a string without using the library function?


19. Write a program to print all numbers between 1 & 100 which are divisible by 3 and 5 both?
