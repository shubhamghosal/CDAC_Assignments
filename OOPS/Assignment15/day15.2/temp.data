Create Point class Point2D   : for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

3.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.


3.2 Add a method to return string form of  point's x & y co-ords
Hint :  public String getDetails()) 


3.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.


3.4 Add a method to Point2D class -- to create and return new point having given x & y offset.
eg : Point2D p1=new Point2D(10,20);
Point2d p3=p1.createNewPoint(5,-2);
If user supplies offset of (5, -2) : your method should return a new point object placed at (15,18)


3.5 Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point & specified point & return the distance to the caller.
Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.
double calcDistance(Point2D anotherPointRef)
{
}

Day 3

1. Revise entire class work.

1.1 Import eclipse project day3.1 in your workspace

Solve this
Double box width for all boxes having volume > 100.(USE for-each & solve this : for understnding for-each clearly)


1.5 Solve this without IDE pls.
Copy earlier created Point2D class  n place it under the package "com.geometry"
Copy earlier created TestPoint class n place it under "tester" package.
Solve compiler errors n run it without IDE , w/o setting classpath
Then set CLASSPATH , so that you can run it from anywhere



2. Solve
Create new eclipse project "day3_assgnment"
Copy Point2D class n TestPoints class along with the packages in IDE.

2.1 Create a new tester in package "com.tester" : TestPointArray
 Prompt user , how many points to plot?
Create suitable data structure  , to store Point2D type of references.
eg : Point2D[] points=new Point2D[sc.nextInt()];//10

2.2 Add a menu , Run the application till user chooses option 10 (exit)

1 Plot a new point
I/P --index , x & y
eg : If user supplies 5 50 100
Create a Point2D with x, y of (50,100) & its reference should be stored at the 5th index position in array.
eg : if (index < .... && points[index] == null)
         points[index] =new Point2D(....);
       else
         sop("point plotting error!!!!!");

2 Display all points plotted so far. (Use for-each)
Q : is null checking required ? 
for (Point2D p : points)
    sop(p);

3. Test equality of 2 points
I/P : index1 , index 2
eg If user enters 1 7 , you have to check if point at 1st n 7th index is same.
If same , print "SAME" , otherwise print "DIFFERENT"

4. Calculate distance
I/P strt , end point indexes.
eg : If user enters 2 6
Find out the distance between 2nd & 6th point. (array indexes start from 0)

10. Exit

Note : Boundary condition checking & null checking is expected.
(Meaning : if user supplies invalid index , then give error message : invalid index --out of range
If no point is plotted at user specified index , then give error message : invalid index -- no point plotted here.)

Day 4

Create Emp based organization structure --- Emp , Mgr , Worker
All of above classes must be in package--com.app.org

2.1 Emp state--- id(int), name, deptId(string) , basic(double)

Behaviour ---1.  get emp details -- use toString.
2. compute net salary ---
eg : public double computeNetSalary()

2.2 Mgr state  ---id,name,basic,deptId , perfmonceBonus
Behaviour ----1. get mgr details :  override toString. 
2. compute net salary (formula: basic+performanceBonus) 
3. get performance bonus. --add a new method to return bonus.(getter)


2.3 Worker state  --id,name,basic,deptId,hoursWorked,hourlyRate
Behaviour--- 
1. get worker details -- :  override toString.
2.  compute net salary (formula:  = basic+(hoursWorked*hourlyRate) --override computeNetSalary
3. get hrlyRate of the worker  -- add a new method to return hourly rate of a worker.(getter)

Can you organize these classes in inheritance  hierarchy.

2.4 Write TestOrganization in "tester" package.
Create suitable data structure  to store organization details.

Provide following options. Run the application till "exit"
